**DESCRIPTION**:
Singly Linked List Implementation in C
Introduction
A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure used to store and manage dynamic data efficiently. Unlike arrays, linked lists provide flexible memory management, allowing easy insertion and deletion of elements without reallocating memory. This project focuses on implementing a modular and efficient singly linked list in C, supporting operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. The program is designed to be user-friendly, menu-driven, and highly efficient for handling dynamic data.

Project Overview
This project implements a singly linked list using a struct-based node representation. The program includes the following operations:

Insertion at the Beginning – Adds a new node at the start of the list.
Insertion at the End – Adds a new node at the end of the list.
Deletion of a Node – Removes a node based on the given value.
Traversal – Displays the list elements sequentially.
Exit – Terminates the program.
Each operation is implemented as a separate function to ensure modularity and maintainability.
